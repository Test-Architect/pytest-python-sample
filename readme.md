# QA Automation (PageObjectModel based) Project
**Developer:** Israel Wasserman [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/israel-wasserman/)

### Overview
This repository serves as a portfolio project showcasing my skills in QA automation and Python development. It demonstrates the development and execution of automated tests using Python, Selenium, and Pytest. The project includes comprehensive UI tests, API tests, as well as validations for both server-side and client-side functionality. These tests are designed to run on a custom web application I developed, [Car Sphere (Live)](https://carsphere.onrender.com/), (*The site takes about a minute to be loaded*) using Python and Flask, leveraging SQLite and SQLAlchemy for database management.

The source code for the project is available in my [CarSphere Repository](https://github.com/IsraelW18/CarSphere.git).

**Design Pattern: Page Object Model (POM)**
This project is structured according to the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. POM is a widely-used approach in test automation that encourages the separation of test logic from page-specific code by representing each web page as a dedicated class. This design improves code maintainability, readability, and reusability, making it easier to scale and update tests as the application evolves.

The automated testing suite ensures the reliability, scalability, and robustness of the application by covering multiple layers:
- UI Tests: Validate the functionality and behavior of the web interface.
- API Tests: Ensure that API endpoints work as expected and return the correct responses.
- Server-Side Tests: Verify the backend logic and database interactions.
- Client-Side Tests: Check client-side behavior, such as JavaScript validations and DOM manipulations.
- The project highlights not only my ability to create comprehensive and efficient automation frameworks but also my proficiency in developing scalable web applications using Python and Flask, adhering to best practices in software testing and development.

### Features
- Automation of end-to-end test cases for web applications.
- Use of Pytest for test organization, parametrization, and reporting.
- Integration of Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
- Comprehensive test logging and reporting.
- Modular and reusable code structure for easy scalability.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
- **Pytest**: Framework for organizing and executing tests.
- **Git**: Version control.
