## Draft Rule: “Modular, Configurable, Extensible & Executable Automation Framework”

1. **Separation of Concerns**

   * ✂️ **Layered Architecture**:

     * **Test Logic Layer** — human-readable test methods or BDD scenarios
     * **Action Layer** — reusable keywords/page-object methods
     * **Infrastructure Layer** — drivers, HTTP clients, device setup
   * 🔄 Changes in one layer never ripple into others.

2. **Configuration-Driven**

   * ⚙️ All environment details (URLs, credentials, timeouts, parallelism flags) live in external config (YAML/JSON/env-vars).
   * 🗂️ Support multiple profiles (e.g. dev/staging/prod, emulator vs real-device).

3. **Data-Driven & Parameterization**

   * 📊 Drive inputs and expected outcomes from external data sources (CSV, JSON, DB).
   * 🔄 Tests iterate over data sets without code changes.

4. **Reusable Components**

   * 📦 **Page Object Model** for UI; **Service Objects** for APIs.
   * 🔗 Shared “utils” library for logging, waits, formatters, etc.

5. **Readable & Consistent Naming**

   * 🏷️ Test names read like specs (e.g. `test_user_can_login_with_valid_credentials`).
   * 📚 Consistent case conventions for classes and methods.

6. **Robust Error Handling & Recovery**

   * 🚨 Wrap low-level exceptions in framework-specific errors with clear messages.
   * 🔄 Self-healing retries for transient UI/API flakiness.

7. **Parallel & Cross-Platform Execution**

   * ⚡ Tests run in parallel with isolated contexts.
   * 📱 Abstract platform specifics so same suite covers web, mobile, API.

8. **Built-In Reporting & Logging**

   * 📝 Per-test logs, screenshots/video on failure, HTML/JSON reports.
   * 📊 Integrations for dashboards (Allure, ReportPortal, etc.).

9. **CI/CD Integration**

   * 🤖 Out-of-the-box pipeline scripts (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure).
   * 🔀 Branch triggers: smoke on PR, full regression on main.

10. **Versioning & Dependency Management**

    * 📦 Lockfiles (pom.xml, requirements.txt/Poetry, package-lock.json).
    * 🔒 Routine dependency updates & vulnerability scans.

11. **Extensibility & Plug-in Support**

    * 🧩 Clear extension points (interfaces/abstract classes).
    * 📄 Drop-in modules for new drivers, reporters, helpers.

12. **Documentation & Onboarding**

    * 📖 “Getting Started” README covering setup, local runs, adding tests.
    * 🛠️ Inline comments for non-obvious hooks or conventions.

13. **🚀 Executable Sample Test**

    * 📁 **Include at least one end-to-end sample** in your starter repo.
    * 🏃 Provide a smoke-suite (e.g., login flow) that:

      1. Reads from config
      2. Uses page-objects/service clients
      3. Asserts a visible post-condition
      4. Passes with a single `pytest`/`mvn test`/`npm test` command
    * 🎯 This ensures new adopters can clone, install, and immediately validate the framework.
